# # Computing 8 Assignment
# 

# ---
# ## Background
# 
# Object oriented programming languages are often used when designing and developing complex systems such as movement systems for a robot. In this assignment, you will be implementing a **Drone** class for a robot. Flying drones such as quadcopters are now commonplace with many consumers. Our class will help keep track of the properties of our drone, and its location in space. Specifically, we will track.
# 
# -	The drones’s name
# -	The drone's battery percentage
# -	The drones’s X coordinate in space
# -   The drone's Y coordinate in space
# -   The drone's altitude in space
# 
# Our movement system for our drone can be thought of as an infinitely large grid, where [0,0] is the respective **X** and **Y** coordinates of our drone in its starting position. Additionally, we also have a third dimension (**Z**) which is the altitude of the drone, which can be only 0 or greater. 
# 
# You will also be required to write a **function** that utilizes your **Drone** class, the details of which are provided in your Program Requirements below. 

# ### ---
# ## Program Requirements (12 Marks)
# 
# ### Requirements - Drone Class
# 
# The requirements for the **Drone** class are given below. Please ensure that your methods have the EXACT naming as specified! Failure to do so will result in lost marks.
# 
# ***Note: you must include a try and except statement in at least one method in your code.***
# 
# 1.	Create an **\_\_init\_\_**(*name*) method that takes the following arguments:
# 
#     ***name***: A *string* representing the name of the Drone. The variable is assigned to an instance variable. If *name* is an empty string, the instance variable is set to the string **"Default"**.
#     
#     The method also initializes the following instance variables:
#     
#     - An *int* representing the drones’s battery. The drones’s battery is initially set to **100**.  
#     - An *int* representing the drones’s X coordinate. The drones’s initial X coordinate is **0**.  
#     - An *int* representing the drones’s Y coordinate. The drones’s initial Y coordinate is **0**.
#     - A *string* representing the drones’s altitude in meters. The drones’s initial altitude coordinate is **0m**.
# 
# 
# 2.	Create the following **accessor** methods:
# 
#     -	**get_name**: Returns the Drones’s name.  
#     -	**get_X**: Returns the drone's X coordinate
#     -	**get_Y**: Returns the drone's Y coordinate 
#     -	**get_coords**: Returns the drone's X and Y coordinates in the list format: [X,Y]
#     -	**get_altitude**: Returns the drone's altitude
#     -	**get_charge**: Returns the drone's current battery life
#     
#     
# 3.	Create the **mutator** method *charge*()
#     -	**Method description**: The method does not return anything, but sets the drone's battery to **100**.
#     
#     
#     
# 4.	Create the **mutator** method **move_x**(*val*) 
#     -	***val***: An *int*.  
#     -	**Method description**: The method does not return anything, but moves the drone's X coordinate by **val**. **val** can be a positive or negative number. Note that this method moves the drone *relative* to it's current positon. If the drone's current X coordinate is **3**, moving the drone by +5 will set the new X coordinate to **8**.
#     - This method drains the drone's battery life by **5**. Ensure the battery value does not turn negative as 0 is the lowest possible battery life.
#     - **IMPORANT**: If the drone's battery life is **0**, this method does not move the drone, and instead returns the following message:
#     <center>"Error - Please charge the drone"</center>
#     
#     
# 5.	Create the **mutator** method **move_y**(*val*) 
#     -	***val***: An *int*.  
#     -	**Method description**: The method does not return anything, but moves the drone's Y coordinate by **val**. **val** can be a positive or negative number. Note that this method moves the drone *relative* to it's current positon. If the drone's current Y coordinate is **-10**, moving the drone by -7 will set the new Y coordinate to **-17**.
#     - This method also drains the drone's battery life by **5**. Ensure the battery value does not turn negative as 0 is the lowest possible battery life.
#     - **IMPORANT**: If the drone's battery life is **0**, this method does not move the drone, and instead returns the following message:
#     <center>"Error - Please charge the drone"</center>
#     
#     
# 6.	Create the **mutator** method **fly_to**(*new_x*,*new_y*)
#     -	**Method description**: The method does not return anything, but instead **sets** the drone's X and Y coordinates to **new_x** and **new_y** respectively. **new_x** and **new_y** can be positive or negative numbers. This method overwrites the drone's current coordinates.
#     - This method also drains the drone's battery life by **10**. Ensure the battery value does not turn negative as 0 is the lowest possible battery life.
#     - **IMPORANT**: If the drone's battery life is **0**, this method does not move the drone, and instead returns the following message:
#     <center>"Error - Please charge the drone"</center>
#     
# 7.	Create the **mutator** method **move_altitude**(*height*)
#     -   ***height***: An *int*.
#     -   **Method description**: The method adds or subtracts the current altitude of the drone by **height**, and returns the new altitude of the drone as a string. If the new altitude is **negative**, the method sets the drone's altitude to 0 instead.
#     - This method also drains the drone's battery life by **15**.
#     - **IMPORANT**: If the drone's battery life is **0**, this method does not move the drone, and instead returns the following message:
#     <center>"Error - Please charge the drone"</center>
#  
# 
# **WE HAVE SAID THIS 5 TIMES ALREADY --- THE DRONE WILL MOVE AS LONG AS THE BATTERY IS NOT ZERO. THE BATTERY PERCENT CANNOT BECOME NEGATIVE. FOR EXAMPLE :: 5% - 10% = 0%**
#  
#  
# --- 
# ### Requirements -  Class Function
# You are also required, in a seperate cell, to create a **function** that will utilize your **Drone** class.
# 
# 1.	Define the function **evasive_maneuvers**(*drone1*,*e_x*,*e_y*)
#     -   **drone1**: A *Drone* object
#     -   ***e_x***: An *int*.
#     -   ***e_y***: An *int*.
#     -   **Function description**: This function makes the drone perform an evasive maneuver, which consists of **5 movements**. For each of the **5 movements**, the X, Y, and altitude values follow the values below:
#     
#         - The X coordinate of the drone oscillates between having *e_x* added to it, and then subtracted from it **5 times**. For example, if the initial X coordinate of the drone was 3, and *e_x* was 4, the 5 X coordinate movements would be: <u>7, 3, 7, 3, 7</u>
#          - The Y coordinate of the drone has *e_y* continuously subtracted from it **5 times**. For example, if the initial Y coordinate of the drone was 10, and *e_y* was 5, the 5 Y coordinate movements would be: <u>5, 0, -5, -10, -15</u>
#          - The function should return all sets of X and Y coordinates as a **list of lists** . For example:
#          [[7,5], [3,0], [7,-5], [3,-10], [7,-15]] 
#          - This function  drains the drone's battery severly by setting it to **1**.
#          - **IMPORANT**: If the drone's battery life is **0**, this function does not move the drone, and instead returns the following message:
#     <center>"Error - Please charge the drone"</center>
#

# ## Code Legibility (6 Marks)
# Your code will be marked on commenting and code legibility.<br>
# The mark breakdown is as follows:<br>
# > 2 marks for using appropriate variable names that indicate what is being stored in that variable<br>
# 2 marks for leaving comments on major parts of your code such as where you read the file or calculate a summation<br>
# 2 marks for exception handling. Your functions should produce the required outputs even when receiving unexpected inputs

# ---
# ## Test Plan (6 Marks)
# Develop a test plan for your program. Your test plan should have at least three test cases: one normal case, one boundary case, and one abnormal case. You can test any function but you must test **at least two different** functions. Please use the following format for your test cases:
# 
# **Function:**   
# **Input:**  
# **Output:**  
# **Excepted Output:**  
# **Pass/Fail:**  
# 
# An example test case is shown below:  
# ```
# Function: fly_to(self,new_x,new_y)
# Input: d = Drone("QDrone")
#        d.fly_to(10,20)
#        print(d.get_coords() == [10,20])
# Excpected Output: True
# Output: True
# Pass/Fail: Pass
# ```
# 
# Implement your testing plan in the cell below! 

# ```
# BOUNDARY CASE:
# Function: move_altitude(self, val)
# Input: d = Drone("QDrone")
#        d.alt = 2
#        d.move_altitude(-3)
#        print(d.get_altitude())
# Excpected Output: '0m'
# Output: '0m'
# Pass/Fail: Pass
# 
# NORMAL CASE:
# Function: move_y(self, val):
# Input: d = Drone("QDrone")
#        d.move_y(20)
#        print(d.get_coords())
# Excpected Output: [0,20]
# Output: [0,20]
# Pass/Fail: Pass
# 
# ABNORMAL CASE:
# Function: evasive_maneuvers(drone1,e_x,e_y)
# Input: d = Drone("QDrone")
#        print(evasive_maneuvers(d,5,'ksahdlafslaf'))
# Excpected Output: 'Error - Can only move by numbers'
# Output: 'Error - Can only move by numbers'
# Pass/Fail: Pass
# ```

# ## Reflective Questions
# 
# 1. Currently, our program does not do anything if the battery of the drone reaches 0, even if the drone is in flight. How could you implement a way to make the drone land if the battery ever reaches 0 after any movement?
# 
# 
# 2. Suppose we had a method ***rename_drone(self,name)*** that renames your drone object with *name*. Would this method be an accessor or mutator?
# 
# 
# 3. How could you modify this program to deplete the battery based on how far the drone moved in the **move_x(), move_y(), and move_altitude()** methods rather than a preset depletion everytime a movement method is called?
# 
# Please answer all questions in the cell below!

# ```
# 1) At the end of any method or function that moves the drone, there should be a conditional statement that checks if the battery has reached zero. It would then set altitude to zero in order to land the drone.
# 
# 2) Mutator because it changes the object's properties.
# 
# 3) In all the movement methods, we could instead have a predertemined "battery loss per unit moved" variable. The battery depletion would then be equal to that variable times the value we moved the drone by.
# 
# ```
